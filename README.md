turnbased-battle
================

My attempt at creating a turn based battle game with python. It's very basic but I plan to expand upon it.
Right now it includes the rudimentary basics that make a fighting game work. Health and attacks.

The next update I'm going to add a stamina requirement for using the different moves, fix any bugs, and make modifiers
for attacking and defending.
